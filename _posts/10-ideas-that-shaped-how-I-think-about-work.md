Over the past few years, I’ve been rethinking how I approach work, not just in terms of career growth but also how I want to build, create, and live. These are some of the ideas shaping that shift:

## 1. Stacking of Skills (Scott Adams)
Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, talks about the power of stacking multiple skills instead of mastering just one. You don’t need to be world-class at a single thing; you can be good at several and create a unique combination that’s hard to compete with. This mindset is liberating because it allows me to pursue breadth without guilt and connect dots others might miss. The compounding effect of knowing how to design and coding has been super empowering for me. I am curious how I can learn more AI skills, improve on storytelling and branding to challenge this even further. 

## 2. Attention is the New Currency
In a noisy world, attention is scarce and valuable. Whether it’s building a product, growing an audience, or pitching an idea, the ability to capture and hold attention is now as important as the product itself. I need to get better at storytelling, enhancing clarity, and building trust.

## 3. Taste as a Differentiator (Especially in the AI Era)
AI is democratizing access to tools and knowledge. What sets people apart now is taste: the ability to curate, refine, and decide what’s good and implement that intentionally in the products and services. 

## 4. Thinker-Doer (Steve Jobs)
Steve Jobs famously advocated for the thinker-doer approach, emphasizing that the best ideas and most impactful innovations come from people deeply involved in both thinking and execution. He believed true creativity arises from this integration, citing Leonardo da Vinci—artist and scientist—as the archetype. As Jobs put it, “Real artists ship.” It’s a reminder that ideas is not enough, knowing how to execute makes all the difference.

## 5. Everything is Created by Someone (Steve Jobs)
Jobs also reminded us, “Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.” That perspective is incredibly empowering. The systems and tools we see as fixed were made by someone, which means they can be remade and made even better. I ask myself this all the time, how can I make this better?

## 6. The Power of Small Teams
Small, tight-knit teams with competent individuals can move faster, experiment more, and stay closer to the people they’re serving. They’re nimble, less political, and often more creative. I have experienced this in the earlier days of Open Government Products and I am keen to recreate that feeling again.

## 7. Show Up Consistently
Progress is rarely about big bursts of effort. It’s about showing up again and again, even when it feels small or slow. Consistency compounds. I have been trying to exercise everyday for the past 8 years and I have been trying to create and build something every week. It has helped me feel more confident about myself and what I can do. 

## 8. The Rise of the Super ICs
There’s a growing demand for “super individual contributors,” people who can own an entire problem space, have skills across the stack. I enjoy interacting with people, collaborating, sharing knowledge, and mentoring others. At the same time, I want to stay focused on the craft and grow in my work without spending all day in meetings, debating semantics, or navigating office politics.

## 9. The Rise of Hybrid Roles: Design Engineers, Creator-Builders, Design Founders
Lines between roles are blurring. Design engineers who can build, creator-builders who can connect with their audience while they build in public, and design founders who bring taste and vision into companies from day one. AI is accelerating this shift by empowering generalist builders who can go from idea to prototype to product without waiting for permission.

## 10. Balancing the 5 Types of Wealth (Sahil Bloom)
Sahil Bloom’s framework and being self aware of my corporate experiences reframed success for me. Wealth isn’t just financial. There’s financial wealth (money), time wealth (control over your time), social wealth (relationships and community), physical wealth (health and energy), and spiritual wealth (purpose and inner peace). True success is balance, building in a way that doesn’t burn through the other forms of wealth.

## Where I’m Heading
These ideas are influencing how I want to build my career and company: small, nimble teams, a deep focus on problem solving, value creation, craft, taste and storytelling, leaning into hybrid skill sets, using AI to amplify my own skills, and staying consistent.

I’m still figuring it out, but my goal is clear: to work in a way that compounds across all five forms of wealth—while building meaningful things with people I respect. To enjoy life, enjoy work, and live sustainably and calmly.
