Through different experiences, I’ve learned a lot about the type of environment I don’t want to be a part of.

I’ve seen what happens when managers are parachuted into roles far above proven ability, while ICs who have delivered impact are overlooked. It signals that leadership doesn’t know or value what “good” actually looks like.

I’ve experienced how damaging sweeping statements can be. Phrases like “you’re wasting your time”, “I will not hesitate to fire you,” or “if you’re not happy, you can leave” create fear, not motivation, even though the stated values claim to champion initiative, innovation and autonomy.

I’ve noticed how demoralising it is when people’s contributions go unappreciated, and leaders claim credit for the work (“I did this, I thought of that”) instead of recognising the individuals who actually executed it.

Being quick and harsh to judge or punish, yet overly conservative and hesitant when it comes to rewarding good work makes people disengaged, fearful, and unwilling to go the extra mile.

I’ve watched leadership overreact and assume the worst of people, launching multiple investigations and creating an atmosphere of fear and suspicion.

I’ve seen how unhealthy it is when yes-men and yes-women are rewarded, disagreements are met with defensiveness, and dissenters are labelled as “ingrates” and “insubordinate.”

I’ve observed how dismissing and disregarding feedback eventually makes people stop sharing it altogether, creating a culture where no one feels safe to speak up.

I’ve experienced environments where, rather than recognizing teamwork, glue work, and strong soft skills, leadership casts suspicion, insinuating people are “colluding” or “double-dipping” impact, and pits team members against one another instead of celebrating collaboration.

Constantly changing direction and flip-flopping between two opposing paths confuses people, makes it almost impossible for teams to align and calibrate. The constant rush leaves little room to deliver quality.


All of this has made it clear that I value environments built on fairness, psychological safety, genuine recognition, and leaders who lift their teams up rather than tear them down, and those are the kinds of environments I hope to create and foster.
